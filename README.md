# ðŸ¥· Ninja Game â€“ Pygame OOP Project

> A side-scrolling ninja platformer game built using **Pygame** with **object-oriented programming**. This project is part of my learning journey â€” updated daily to track progress and build habits.

## ðŸš§ Progress Log

### ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ *\[2025-07-15]*

* Created the `Game()` class to manage the main game loop.
* Set up the game window (`640x480`) and background.
* Set the window title to "Ninja Game".
* Added basic quit functionality (close button works).
* Frame rate limited to 60 FPS using `pygame.time.Clock()`.

---

### ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ *\[2025-07-19]*

* Created a `PhysicsEntity` object to represent the player and handle horizontal movement (no animation yet).
* Implemented **gravity physics** with gradual acceleration up to a cap.
* Added a utility function to **load a single image**.
* Introduced a `data/` folder to store all images and assets.

---

### ðŸ“… Day 3 â€“ *\[2025-07-20]*

* Added `tilemap.py` and implemented a `Tilemap` class for handling different tile types.
* Wrote a utility function to **load and return images as lists**.
* Rendered tiles on screen (initial rendering for learning purposes; not final visuals).

---

### ðŸ“… Day 4 â€“ *\[2025-07-21]*

* Implemented **collision detection** and **player jumping**.
* Used collision detection to ensure the player stands on the ground instead of passing through it.
* Tweaked gravity: acceleration resets to `0` upon ground collision and ramps up again when falling.

---

### ðŸ“… Day 5 â€“ *\[2025-07-22]*

* Implemented **camera movement** relative to the player.
* Added a **background image**.
* Added **clouds** with parallax-style depth, movement, and looping for a more dynamic sky.

---

### ðŸ“… Day 6 â€“ *\[2025-07-23]*

* Optimized tile rendering (only drawing whatâ€™s needed / prepping for culling off-screen tiles).

---

### ðŸ“… Day 7 â€“ *\[2025-07-27]*

* Added **player animation** for idle, run, and jump states.
* Implemented **flipped animation** when the player faces left/right.
* Created a **`Player` object** inheriting from `PhysicsEntity`, with player-specific settings.

### ðŸ“… Day 8 & 9 â€“ *\[2025-07-29 â†’ 2025-07-30]*

* Built a **level editor** from scratch and added it via `editor.py`.
* Enabled **tile placement and deletion** using the mouse â€” supports both **ongrid** and **offgrid** tiles.
* Implemented **map navigation** using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys.
* Added **mouse scroll** to switch tile groups and **Shift + scroll** to cycle group variants.
* Pressing `G` toggles between **ongrid/offgrid** placement mode (default: ongrid).
* Pressing `O` allows you to **save the current map** as `map.json`.
* Pressing `T` **autotiles grass and stone tiles** to simplify level creation.
* Fixed an issue with **left-direction collision detection** allowing slight overlap.

---

### ðŸ“… Day 10 â€“ *\[2025-07-31]*

* Added a new file: **`particle.py`**.
* Implemented a **leaf fall particle effect** for trees, adding natural ambience to the environment.
